# Godot ArrayUtils
A (hopefully soon-to-be) collection of static utilitiy functions for arrays in GDScript.

## Main Utils
- **sort()**: a stable sorting implementation (since the one provided in GDScript is unstable)

## Other utils
Some helpers, mostly meant for use together with the main utilities
- **Comparators**: a few comparators for some common data types, readymade for sorting
